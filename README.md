## Project Context

Using all of the skills you’ve developed over the last two trimesters, you’re going to team up with a partner in creating your very own API from start to finish. You’ll develop a design, narrow down what should be in your MVP (minimum viable product), and work together as a team to bring your idea to life. You have a limited number of days to work on this project, so be sure to keep your scope reasonable for you and your team.
